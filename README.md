# Automatic-temperature-control-MSP432P401R-
An automatic temperature switch 

# Description
This system uses the STM32F410  NUCLEO development board. It implements an automatic temperature switch. It also features an lcd screen to display relevant information like current temperature and set value. The desired temperature is set using a temperature knob. The system then compares this value with the current temperature reading fron a temperature system. If the current temperature is below the set temperature, the system turns the heater on(using a relay switch) and if the current temperature is above the set temperature, the system turns the heater off. This project is primarily written in C language.
